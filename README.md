# credible-or-not

As part of the [Hack The Press Hackathon](https://hackthepress.org/) our team wanted to design a chrome extension visible on news websites to ascertain whether the site is credible or not before you read it!

## The problem
People will read the news and take the information as fact. Even when newspapers are found have made mistakes and are forced to publish their apologies the information is already out there, and it is often too late. 

## Ideas
Initially we wanted to be able to find a data source that could tell us how many court cases a newspaper had against it combined with how many sources were sited in the article. However there was no API nor was there up-to-date information and so we quickly moved on.

We found [Glitched news](https://glitched.news/) and decided to use this instead.

## TWL (things we learned)

Git rebasing, git commands
How to build a Chrome extension
How to create an iFrame in said chrome extension
